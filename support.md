# Support My Creations

I am an independent creator and freelancer. If you got value from my videos, podcasts, or classes on Skillshare and youâ€™d like to support me in creating more of those resources and pieces of art, please consider becoming a one-time or monthly contributor.

Alternatively, you can also become a YouTube Member, support the Channel and Videos I create there, and also enjoy some special badges and occasionall exclusive videos.
