# Support My Creations

I am an independent creator and freelancer. If you got value from my videos, podcasts, or classes on Skillshare and youâ€™d like to support me in creating more of those resources and pieces of art, please consider becoming a one-time or monthly contributor. Thank you for your consideration.
