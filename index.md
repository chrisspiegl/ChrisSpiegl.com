# Creator

I am a traveling [content creator](/youtube). I have been working online for the past 15 years and have done so from over 30 countries. So one could say, I love the location independent lifestyle.

> “My goal is to work with motivated and inspiring people.”

My goal is to work with motivated people to build highly successful businesses and brands. To improve your own life and to have a positive effect on the people around you and me.

> “A business should be built for the purpose of providing the owner with pure personal freedom — whatever that means to them.”
> <cite>Timothy Marc</cite>

I’m focused on building businesses that support life – instead of creating businesses that consume all your time and suck life out of you. Remodeling workflows and improving efficiency, optimizing and outsourcing parts of your business are things I enjoy.

I do this by having conversations with people from around the world in my [Podcasts](/podcast) and by sharing my findings, process, and ideas on my [YouTube Channel](/youtube).

If you want tok now what I am currently focusing on, please read my [NOW Page](/now) and if you'd like to discuss an idea or share some feedback, please contact me via email which you can find below.

Now, have an amazing day. Focus on what’s important and let's get it done!
