A movie that has me motivated. Motivated to write more on this website, write more in my journal, and in long form.

Overall it may not be the highest quality movie ever, but I found the message resonate with me at this time. Going out into the world and to do what I truly want to do with a bit less regard to the future and what it may bring. One could also call it surrender into the circumstances and let go for the ride (albite maybe with a bit more caution than presented in this film).
