## Discontinued: Thoughts, Stories, and Ideas in Voice (English)

Discontinued at the end of 2021 in favor of creating more [YouTube videos](https://crsp.li/youtube).

Exploring life, productivity, random thoughts, and business ideas. I love to get out there and create. Make something new and try new things – hence why I am finally trying podcasting. What will this be? First, it’s a challenge to step out of my comfort zone, and hopefully, that can already inspire.

Episodes with videos can be viewed in the [YouTube Playlist](https://crsp.li/PlaylistPodcastThoughtsStorie).
