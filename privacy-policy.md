# Privacy Policy

## General

Your personal data (e.g. title, name, house address, e-mail address, phone number, bank details, credit card number) are processed by us only in accordance with the provisions of German data privacy laws. The following provisions describe the type, scope, and purpose of collecting, processing and utilizing personal data. This data privacy policy applies only to our web pages. If links on our pages route you to other pages, please inquire there about how your data are handled in such cases.

## Inventory data

(1) Your personal data, insofar as these are necessary for this contractual relationship (inventory data) in terms of its establishment, the organization of content and modifications, are used exclusively for fulfilling the contract. For goods to be delivered, for instance, your name and address must be relayed to the supplier of the goods.

(2) Without your explicit consent or a legal basis, your personal data are not passed on to third parties outside the scope of fulfilling this contract. After completion of the contract, your data are blocked against further use. After expiry of deadlines as per tax-related and commercial regulations, these data are deleted unless you have expressly consented to their further use.

## Tracking

This entire website does NOT use Facebook Social Plugins, Pixels, or Twitter Share buttons.

The only tracking tool that is being used is the locally installed Matomo Analytics tool which in addition, any IP address or personal identifier is made anonymous, and is also setup not not to use any cookies. You can learn more about what Matomo can track [here](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_18254/).

Sometimes there is embedded content which might have tracking based on the service used (YouTube or Instagram most notably).

I am running a server in the Netherlands and their logs which may include your IP address but this information is not further processed in any way.

The hosting company used for this website is [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) and for faster loading and site security I also use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Both of these service providers are GDPR compliant and may have access to your IP address and other data.

The website runs on [11ty](https://https://www.11ty.dev), a static site generator.
