# Almost Weekly Newsletter

In a world where stories disappear after 24 hours and we are overwhelmed by all kinds of tweets, instagram posts, and moreâ€¦ I see myself going back to email more and more.

This is my newsletter where I compile my thoughts, share what is going on, and send out recommendations of services, books, movies, and other things that I have found.

You can unsubscribe at any moment (at the bottom of each email).
