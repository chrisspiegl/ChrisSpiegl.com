# Consulting

## Working Smarter

Over the past 10+ years, I’ve collected loads of knowledge in the area of social media marketing, website building and optimization, and online marketing, through books, articles, courses and lots of trial and error. Now I want to put this knowledge to good use for your business.

> “Small changes can have a great impact on your revenue. We’ll work together to put these small changes in place to give you an edge – Work smarter and harder at the same time.”

## A Look At Your Business

We’ll have a look at your business – how it is structured and what your goals are. Based on this knowledge, we’ll take a look at your distribution channels (your website, blog, social media profiles and other platforms). One by one we’ll analyze them and reveal what we can improve or optimize to gain more visitors and increase your conversion rate. We might decide to rebuild some parts of your site, modify the design or create a totally new branding – I am here to help you all along the way.

## More Traffic With Less Time

Once those first improvements are implemented it’s all about getting more traffic to your site. We’ll have a look at some new marketing tactics and campaigns, hustling our way to get some media attention or work with social media engagement – which has proven to be very valuable in this day and age.

> “We work on the business and that’s only possible if the business does not consume all your time!”

## The Next Level

We’ll bring your business to the next level. By improving your user experience, increasing your conversion rate and in the whole process achieving the one goal every business has – a high revenue. And not to forget: By having an extra focus on the systems of your business, we’ll accomplish more while reducing the time spent operating it – we are here to work on the business and that’s only possible if the business does not consume all your time!

Now, let’s get in touch and have a look at your business in a 30 to 60 minute Google Hangouts call. Just [send me an email](mailto:chris@chrisspiegl.com?subject=Consulting%20for%20my%20Website "Email Chris for a free Consultation") and we’ll schedule a call in the near future. I will show you right then and there what I’d remove, improve or modify. I provide this first session completely free of charge.

I am looking forward to working with you!
