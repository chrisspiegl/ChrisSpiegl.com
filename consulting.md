## üìù Your Expert Guide to Content Excellence & Peak Productivity

Whether you're a content creator, entrepreneur, or professional, I understand the challenges you face. You want to produce exceptional content and run an efficient business, but technical hurdles and productivity bottlenecks are holding you back.

That's where I come in. With 20+ years of experience (yes, really, I sold my first website at 13 years old) in content creation, technology, programming, and business optimization, I provide personalized solutions that deliver real results.

### Elevate Your Content Production

Transform your content from amateur to professional. I've built multiple YouTube channels (biggest ones have 40k subscribers[^1] & 16k subscribers[^2]) and podcasts (two of which hit the top 2% world wide). I have created reviews for and partnered with dozens of brands like R√∏de, Atomos, Amazon, Adobe, Riverside, Acer, Walkolution, DPA, espresso Display, BOLSTair, Ultrahuman, and many more.

- **Professional Video Production:** Studio setup and equipment optimization, lighting and audio perfection, camera techniques and composition, live streaming mastery, and post-production workflow.
- **Podcast Excellence:** Professional recording setup, audio quality optimization, editing and production workflow, and distribution and promotion strategies.
- **Content Creation Mastery:** YouTube channel optimization, content strategy development, audience engagement techniques, and brand consistency and growth.

### Online Business Strategy and Optimization

I've built and run multiple online businesses (I am currently part of 3) and I can help you with: Business model optimization, audience growth, monetization strategies, and scaling your business.

### Digital Nomadism & Remote Work

Navigate the challenges of location-independent living:

- **International Relocation:** Leaving your home country (I left Germany), adapting to new cultures, and establishing a home base abroad.
- **Remote Work Optimization:** Setting up productive workspaces anywhere, managing time zones, and maintaining work-life balance.
- **Global Living Experience:** Having lived in 8+ countries for 6-12+ months each, I can share practical insights on international living.

### Starting Your Online Business

Launch and grow your online business:

- **Company Structure & Registration:** Setting up an Estonian company and understanding different international business structures.
- **Financial Independence:** Transitioning from steady income to entrepreneurial ventures, managing irregular income, and building financial security.
- **Autonomous Business Operations:** Working without a traditional boss, creating systems for accountability, and maintaining productivity as your own manager.


### Master the Apple Ecosystem

Unlock the full potential of your Apple-based workflow with: Essential productivity tools, second brain & organization systems, security & professional business tools.

### Software development

With 20+ years of software development experience, I prefer keeping things simple. I can guide you in making smart software choices and connect you with professionals who can build and manage custom software for you.

### And more
