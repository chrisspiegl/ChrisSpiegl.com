However, that one is significantly heavier than this one. So, for now, the f4 will be my travel companion to get those compressed portraits, that different perspective in landscapes, and overall open up a whole new range of photography and video work."
11,Canon RF 15-35mm f/2.8,canon-rf-15-35mm-f-2-8,https://crsp.li/RF1535F28,"Camera, Current",TRUE,"Over the years I noticed again and again that this is my area of shooting on full frame. It's a beautiful range for landscape captures as well as video (vlog and otherwise). And for shallower depth of field, I would always stay away from the 4.0 versions of these lenses."
15,Insta360 X3 360 Camera,insta360-x3,https://crsp.li/Insta360X3,"Camera, Current",TRUE,Capturing 360 is completely revolutionizing the action cam genre. Beign able to reframe after the fact makes filming much easier and gives you perspectives which you just could not get in any other way.

It's really incredible what a difference it makes when you can actually stand in front of your tripod for filming — and ofcourse you can also stand behind the camera without being hunched over.

And the best camera is always the one you have with you!"
15,iPhone 11 Pro Max 256GB Black,iphone-11-pro-max,https://crsp.li/iphone11promax,Sold,FALSE,"As always, I am using an iPhone. Right now it's the 11 Pro max. I am actually not sure if I would get the Max again if I had the choice as I would like my phone to be a bit smaller and I usually do all the video and photo editing on a computer anyways. But then again… the Max always has the best cameras and battery power."

It also makes life a little harder (having to remember that there is another variable to take into consideration), but the results are visibly better when done correctly. This is a lovely ND filter and especially: it has stop points so no overdriving it at the ends."
35,Zhiyun Weebill 2 Pro,zhiyun-weebill-2-pro,https://crsp.li/ZhiyunWeebill2Pro,"Current, Camera",TRUE,"Not the first gimbal I owned but certainly the best and most powerful!

I have to say: for almost all use cases I would recommend getting the non-pro. The pro is just not that much better (and it's even a little heavier). But that aside: I love the Capture Clip. I can use it with all the plates I use. It's great! I have one of these mounted to one of the straps of my backpack. The second is mounted to my belt.

70,Tentacle Track E,tentacle-track-e,https://crsp.li/TentacleTrackE,"Current, Camera",TRUE,Recording 32bit float in the field with a tiny recorder and and a lavalier? That's where the Track E shines! It's super light weight and easy to use but at the same time features great audio pre-amps and sound quality. Combined with the Sync E set these recorders are incredible. Just not very usefull when you want to do live streamd… then you'll have to look at the Wireless Go II set!
70,Tentacle Sync E,tentacle-sync-e,https://crsp.li/TentacleSyncE,"Current, Camera",TRUE,Syncronizing multiple cameras can be a pain — especially when they don't support propper timecode. Sadly most mirrorless cameras don't have that feature. But luckily the Tentacle Sync E can give you Timcode on all cameras that have an audio input! And now it's just like 4 clicks to sync all those files up in post!
